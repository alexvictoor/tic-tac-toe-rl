# TicTacToe - Reinforcement learning
This is my very first attempt to learn reinforcement learning, and to be more specific Q-learning, with the game TicTacToe.  
Everything is implemented in TypeScript. Check out the engine folder if you are curious about the Q-learning algorithm implementation. If you are looking for an introduction to Q-learning [this article](https://neuro.cs.ut.ee/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/) is a good start.      
The UI comes straight from the facebook ReactJS tutorial.   
Once loaded, the UI triggers a training session. There is no persistency and the training is done each time the UI is loaded.
