# TicTacToe - Reinforcement learning
This is a toy project to learn reinforcement learning, and to be more specific Q-learning, with the game TicTacToe.
Everything is implemented in TypeScript. Check out the engine folder if you are curious about the Q-learning algorithm.  
The UI comes straight from the facebook ReactJS tutorial.
